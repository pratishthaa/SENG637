# 1 Introduction <a name="intro"></a>

Our goal in this assignment is to write new test cases and utilize the test cases from the previous phase of the project to meet a predetermined code coverage. The JFreeChart package, which allows for the creation of charts in various ways, is the system under test (SUT). It is an open-source Java framework available for free that calculates, creates, and displays charts. Numerous chart types are supported by this framework, such as histograms, pie charts, bar charts, line charts, and several others. The percentage of the source code that is covered while the test suite executes is the code coverage. JFreeChart makes it easy for developers to display professional charts in their applications. In Project 2, we created black-box test cases for ten distinct JFreeChart methods; five of them were in the Range class and the other five were in the DataUtilities class. 
In this assignment, we employ these test cases and test for their code coverage. We hope to achieve a minimum of 
  - 90% statement coverage.
  - 70% branch coverage.
  - 60%  method coverage.
EclEmma was the tool we used to measure the code coverage we obtained. Also, we mention the pros and cons of the tool and the metrics that we use for this phase.
