-   Note that you need to submit a report generated by your defect tracking
    system, containing all defects recorded in the system.

# Notes and discussion of the peer reviews of defect reports

We divided the five people in our group into two sub-groups according to the guidelines in the lab manual regarding pair testing methodology. At least two individuals worked together in each group for each identified bug. This collaborative peer review process helped filter out multiple false-positive bug reports based on discussions on results. Additionally, our team members provided constructive feedback while cross-referencing our internal documentation among our sub-groups for accuracy.
Following this framework, we noted and replicated the bugs identified for version 1.1 protocols. When one individual submitted a bug report, their sub-group partners assessed their work to ensure the prescribed format was followed and to weigh on the presence of those bugs. This review process helped guarantee that each report contained all relevant information, facilitating the accurate diagnosis and understanding of the defect's nature and underlying causes.
We followed the lab manual's guidelines for bug reporting, which included reporting on the function being tested, the system's initial state, specifying the steps required to reproduce the bug, and each test case’s expected and actual outcome.


# How the pair testing was managed and team work/effort was divided 

For this assignment, the essential requirement was pair testing, so we divided our group of five into two sub-groups- Sub-group 1(Pratishtha and Fadila) and sub-group 2(Arpita, Kumkum, Niloofar) performed testing based on the lab manual. The groups explored the system under test, i.e., the ATM Machine v1.0, to understand its functionalities better and performed exploratory testing where one individual ran the test case or any exploratory test case they realized. At the same time, the other person interpreted the results, and the roles were alternated so that both could get hands-on experience in each role. This process was followed by discussions on the bugs reported. The two sub-groups created bugs as work items on the Azure platform. The guidelines provided for Regression testing were followed. Working in pairs helped this process be more efficient as partners provided unique viewpoints and thus minimized the chance of errors. Ultimately, the bugs obtained by exploratory and manual scripted testing were combined, keeping both versions of the ATM in mind.
